<p>A ‘readable’ text invites you to read. It goes beyond simple legibility. Usually, some clever formatting is needed to make the text readable. So how do you make a text readable, rather than just legible?</p>
<h2 id="chunking">Chunking</h2>
<p>A wall of uninterrupted text can put off even the most seasoned readers. Splitting your text into paragraphs helps the reader .
When working in a desktop publishing programs such as InDesign, you can control <em>exactly</em> the amount of space between the paragraphs.</p>
<h2 id="your-heart-is-on-your-left-side">Your heart is on your left side</h2>
<p>&hellip;and so should be your text.</p>
<p>Text formatting on the web got much better in recent years, also CSS now offers much more flexibility. Yet we still see some usual offenders:</p>
<ul>
<li>line length too long,</li>
<li>too much line spacing (or too little),</li>
<li>center-justified text.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples from the New Yorker, The Times, and The Guardian online versions illustrate how to solve that problem: A lot of white space is added to make the line shorter. If a line length is too long, your eyes start trailing off, making reading harder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> A line of 30-40 characters and spaces is a comfortable line length.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many websites still use a full-page layout for the text body, often the text is center-justified, making reading even harder. Your eye needs to ‘anchor’ itself on a straight line of the block of text. Center-justified (aligned) or right-aligned (sometimes called rugged) text is only appropriate for snippets of texts, headlines, and captions. The main body has to be left-aligned, like a mantra: religiously, no exception.</p>
<p>Adding large margins and splitting the text into smaller columns is a good solution. Columns of text shouldn&rsquo;t be too narrow either, as it will make reading harder.</p>

<p><img src="/guardian-article.PNG" alt="Die Zeit article"></p>
<p>The New Yorker and the Guardian used a similar layout, adding lots of white space to the right.</p>
<p>Die Zeit text is centered, but it is left-aligned. It also shows that &lsquo;white space&rsquo; does not need to be white. Sometimes also called &rsquo;negative space&rsquo; it might even be pink-ish/beige, as in the case of Financial Times:
<img src="/ft.PNG" alt="Financial Times"></p>
<p>The most important thing is to be able to focus without the clutter of ads and popups distracting from the text.</p>
<p><img src="/dieZeit.PNG" alt="Die Zeit article"></p>
<p>The New Yorker text is enhanced by a &lsquo;drop cap&rsquo;: the first letter of the text body is much larger than the rest and takes up an extra line.</p>

<p>This hiccup from the days of printing adds visual interest. The effect can be achieved with CSS. Chris Coyer explains the technique in CSS tricks.</p>
