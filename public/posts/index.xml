      <description>Merge PDFs Using Python Working with PDF files can a pain&amp;hellip;but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need any expensive software to do that: just a few lines of Python code.
Tip! Some basic Python knowldege required!
Gather all PDFs you want to merge in the same folder. In the .py file Import PyPDF2 python library Import PdfMerger class Loop over the pdf files (it is handy to have them all in the same folder so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to specify the full path) Create a new pdf file with merger.</description>

      <description>Why create SVG animations using CSS? Animations created with JavaScript (or animated gifs) can become heavy and cause web pages to load slowly. SVGs are light and can be either referenced or embedded directly in the code. The clue to another advantage of using SVGs is in the name - Scalable Vector Graphics. They will look just as great on a tiny mobile screen as on a huge retina display. Thanks to the animation features in CSS3 we can create simple (yet enticing!</description>

      <description>Taxonomy Before you start: why should you create a taxonomy? Let&amp;rsquo;s be blunt: is a taxonomy necessary for your project? Why put extra work and effort into creating a system that many organizations seem to eschew? Let me illustrate with a quote from the kmworld Knowledge workers spend 15 to 35 percent of their time searching for information 40 percent cannot find the information they need on their corporate intranets 15 percent of their time is spent duplicating information that exists but cannot be found If the usability of a system can be improved, the time and effort that has been invested will result in time saved by everyone searching for information.</description>

      <description>Legibility and readability can be easily confused. Let’s start with ‘legibility’, as the more important of the two. Legibility sipmly means that the text can be read. The contrast between the background and the font color is sufficient, the size is suitable, the letterforms can be easily distinguished.
A ‘readable’ text invites you to read. It goes beyond simple legibility. Usually, some clever formatting is needed to make the text readable.</description>
