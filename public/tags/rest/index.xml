      <description>First of all, let us consider whether we can compare those web services. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), as the full name suggests, is a protocol. On the other hand, REST is an architectural style. It allows more flexibility and is considered easier to implement. RESTful applications have become ubiquitous in recent years, with SOAP web services lagging behind. There is no simple answer to whether one is ‘better’ than the other - it depends on the use case.</description>
