      <description>Merge PDFs Using Python Working with PDF files can a pain&amp;hellip;but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need any expensive software to do that: just a few lines of Python code will suffice.
In this quick tutorial I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to easily merge multiple files without having to tinker in the Adobe Acrobat or a similar program, simply taking advantage of the capabilities of the PyPDF2 library. This method is much quicker and cheaper and all the tools used here are free.</description>
