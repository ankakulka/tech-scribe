      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of image editing software out there, most notably Photoshop - but did you know you can also edit images using Python? While Pillow, the Python library used in this tutorial, won&amp;rsquo;t replace Photoshop, it does help you to perform certain actions faster - and completely free.

      <description>Merge PDFs Using Python Working with PDF files can a pain&amp;hellip;but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need any expensive software to handle PDFs: just a few lines of Python code will suffice.

This method is much quicker and cheaper and all the tools used here are free.</description>
