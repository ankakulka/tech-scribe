      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s plenty of image editing software out there, most notably Photoshop - but did you know you can also edit images using Python? While Pillow, the Python library used in this tutorial, won&amp;rsquo;t replace Photoshop, it does help you to perform certain actions faster - and completely free.
In this introductory tutorial I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to convert image format using Pillow library. You can then build on that knowledge to progress to the more advanced concepts, such as Image filters.</description>

      <description>Merge PDFs Using Python Working with PDF files can a pain&amp;hellip;but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be. You don&amp;rsquo;t even need any expensive software to handle PDFs: just a few lines of Python code will suffice.

This method is much quicker and cheaper and all the tools used here are free.</description>

      <description>Why create SVG animations using CSS? Animations created with JavaScript (or animated gifs) can become heavy and cause web pages to load slowly. SVGs are light and can be either referenced or embedded directly in the code. The clue to another advantage of using SVGs is in the name - Scalable Vector Graphics. They will look just as great on a tiny mobile screen as on a huge retina display.</description>
