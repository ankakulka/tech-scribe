# Who am I?

I am an experienced Technical writer, fluent in written and spoken English, familiar with various tools used to create documentation and the best practices of content creation. 

Some of the technologies I have worked with:
- Version Control: git (GitHub and BitBucket)
- Content Management Tools: Paligo, Cosima 

I am not afraid of plunging into new environments -  whether literally or figuratively through learning new technologies. 

During my studies,  I developed a working prototype of a browser-based game with JavaScript - you can try it out by following this link: [Evil Twin game](https://friendly-meringue-6e4eeb.netlify.app/)

To improve my productivity, and to be able to automate routine tasks, I am currently learning Python.
 See my post [Merge-PDFs-using-Python](https://tech-scribe.netlify.app/posts/merge-pdfs-using-python/).
